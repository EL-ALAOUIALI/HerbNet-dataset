# HerbNet-dataset  (under review)

This repository contains the dataset used to train the HerbNet model.

This repository contains the dataset used to train the HerbNet model. The dataset comprises approximately 6,323 images, including 5,187 RGB images from the CottonWeedID15 dataset. These images were captured in 2020 and 2021 using smartphones or handheld digital cameras under natural field illumination and at various stages of weed growth. Additionally, the semi-Moroccan dataset contributes 1,300 images, each a 512 x 512 color image captured under diverse field conditions. The dataset encompasses more than twenty classes of weeds, including one class of sesame crops considered as a negative class. We removed 160 images from our dataset because their characteristics did not meet our criteria.
